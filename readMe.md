# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app also uses local storage to save the tasks, so they persist even after closing the browser.

## Features

1. **Add Todo**: Type a task into the input field and click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.

2. **Complete Todo**: Click the checkmark icon next to a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will have a strike-through effect.

3. **Delete Todo**: Click the trash icon next to a task to delete it from the list.

4. **Filter Todos**: You can filter the displayed tasks using the "Filter" dropdown. Options include "All," "Completed," and "Incomplete."

5. **Local Storage**: The app stores the tasks in the browser's local storage. So, even if you close the browser, your tasks will be saved and restored when you open the app again.
